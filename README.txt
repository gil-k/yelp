Yelp Photos

Visual display of Yelp search results

Instead of showing star rating and business
description in text, user uploaded photos
are dispalyed, visually describing the
business.

For example, searching for "dinner" and any
location, photos of food are displayed
one row per business, as well as star rating,
link to business, and location showing on
googlemap insert.
 
Number of photos for each business, and number of
businesses per page, and type of photos are some
parameters which can be set.

Implemented in Python with Flask, using non-blocking
API requests and web scraping of Yelp user photos.
