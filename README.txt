Visual Yelp

Yelp search results displayed as gallery of user photos,
each row representing a business.

Number of photos for each business, and number of
businesses per page, and type of photos are some
parameters which can be set.

Implemented in Python with Flask, using non-blocking
API requests and web scraping of Yelp user photos.
